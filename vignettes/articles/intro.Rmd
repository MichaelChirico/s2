* S2LatLng points are always latitude-longitude
* internally represented as S2Points, 3-D unit vectors (geocentric)
* S2polyline; when is a polyline invalid
* S2Loop: rings get reordered (different starting point)
* rings are not closed
* polygons are properly nested rings (unlike e.g. MULTIPOLYGON)
* in addition to empty polygon: full polygon
* default polygon building: not oriented, assuming their area is less than `2*pi`
