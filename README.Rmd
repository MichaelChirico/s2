The goal of s2 is to provide R bindings to Google's [S2Geometry](https://s2geometry.io) library. The package exposes an API similar to Google's [BigQuery Geography API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions), whose functions also operate on spherical geometries.

## Installation

You can install the released version of s2 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("s2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-spatial/libs2")
```

## Example

The s2 package provides geometry transformers and predicates similar to those found in [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), except instead of assuming a planar geometry, s2's functions work in latitude and longitude and assume a spherical geometry:

```{r example}
library(s2)

s2_contains(
  # polygon containing much  of the northern hemisphere
  "POLYGON ((-63.5 44.6, -149.75 61.20, 116.4 40.2, 13.5 52.51, -63.5 44.6))",
  # ...should contain the north pole
  "POINT (0 90)"
)
```

The [sf package](https://r-spatial.gitub.io/sf) will soon support s2, but until it does, you can use the [wk package](https://paleolimbot.github.io/wk) to convert data from sf to s2:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)

nc_s2 <- read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")) %>% 
  mutate(geometry = as_s2_geography(wk::wkb(st_as_binary(geometry)))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(NAME, geometry)

nc_s2
```
